### User Story  
* AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications    
    I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples  
    SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position   
### Acceptance Criteria
* GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer  

    WHEN I load the portfolio  
    THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer  

    WHEN I view the header  
    THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio  

    WHEN I view the navigation titles  
    THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact Me, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted  

    WHEN I click on a navigation title  
    THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted  

    WHEN I load the portfolio the first time  
    THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default  

    WHEN I am presented with the About Me section  
    THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them  

    WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section  
    THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository  

    WHEN I am presented with the Contact Me section  
    THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message  

    WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text  
    THEN I receive a notification that this field is required  

    WHEN I enter text into the email address field  
    THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address  

    WHEN I am presented with the Resume section  
    THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies  

    WHEN I view the footer  
    THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
